###Summary

A script to recursively loop through all pages in a Cascade Server folder, compare dates and delete/unpublish all pages older than
a specified date. 

delete-and-unpublish-workflow.xml - Workflow definition required to unpublish at same time as delete (using the WS unpublish operation and then immediately deleting results in "The asset could not be deleted because it is currently being published." error). Create new workflow definition with this XML, replace username (line 32) with a Cascade user with delete/unpublish permissions for the target file(s). After creation, supply the ID in the deleteUnpublish.php script.

deleteUnpublish.php - The Web Services script. You'll need to supply the following:
- 32-digit ID of the folder to check
- 32-digit ID of workflow definition above
- Cascade Server page date variable to check against - one of the following values: 'createdDate', 'lastModifiedDate', 'lastPublishedDate', 'reviewDate', 'startDate', 'endDate'
- UNIX timestamp of date to compare against
- Cascade Server URL, username, password
